Backup Grafana dashboards from the live Grafana server to JSON files in at
grafana/dashboards.

(If the Grafana volume is somehow deleted, Grafana is set up to provision new dashboards
from these the JSON files.)

Warning: All files in grafana/dashboards will be first deleted. This is to ensure that
old dashboards are culled from the repo.
